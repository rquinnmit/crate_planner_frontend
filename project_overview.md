CratePilot
An AI co-pilot for DJs that converts a short event description and seed tracks into a performance-ready, ordered crate. Shrinks crate prep from hours to minutes by combining a structured library, prompt-driven planning, transition scoring, and one-click export to DJ software.

🎯 Problem & Context
The Pain Point: DJs spend significant time digging for tracks and testing what blends—balancing BPM, key, genre, structure, energy, and crowd fit. The workflow is fragmented across streaming sites, DJ apps, and personal notes.

Why Now: Massive track volume and "one-size-fits-all" AI radios don't respect human style, venue constraints, or harmonic mixing rules.

👥 Who It Serves
DJs: Faster prep, better compatibility, fewer risky transitions
Venues & Audiences: Sets that fit the event type and maintain flow
Platforms (Beatport/Beatsource) & DJ Software (Rekordbox/Serato): Cleaner discovery and direct playlist integration
Artists/Labels: Increased discovery by match quality (not just popularity)
✨ Core Features
1. Discovery
Enter "rooftop sunset • tech house • 120–124 BPM" + 2–3 seed tracks → get a 90–120 min crate matched to style and constraints.

2. Library
Normalize & store track metadata/features; reuse across plans.

3. Export
One-click export to Rekordbox/Serato playlists for performance.

🏗️ System Architecture
MusicAssetCatalog
Stores tracks with Tags (artist, title, genre, duration) and Features (BPM, key, sections)
Provides filtered candidate lists (by BPM range, key, genre, etc.)
CratePlanning
Produces an ordered crate that respects a Prompt (tempo range, key, genre, seeds, duration, notes)
Supports user feedback and finalization
PlanExporter
Converts finalized plans to DJ-software-friendly playlist formats
🤖 AI Augmentation
CratePlanning is extended with optional LLM-powered actions (manual path still works):

deriveIntentLLM: Interprets the prompt + seeds, expands constraints
generateCandidatePoolLLM: Builds filter expressions from the derived intent
sequencePlanLLM: Proposes an ordered list satisfying duration and energy trajectory
explainPlanLLM: Natural-language annotations explaining why each transition works
revisePlanLLM: Applies constrained edits from user instructions
LLMSettings: Toggle AI, set model/temperature/prompts; track provenance
Backwards compatibility: Manual createPlan (deterministic heuristic) remains available; all AI features are additive and optional.

📊 Data & Metadata
Tags
artist, title, genre?, duration_sec
Features
bpm, key (Camelot notation like 8A/8B), optional sections, optional energy (1–5)
Prompt
tempoRange?, targetKey?, targetGenre?, sampleTracks?, targetDuration?, notes?
Plus mixingStyle?, energyCurve? (for AI path)
🔄 Workflow (Happy Path)
User prompt & seeds →
(AI on) deriveIntentLLM (expand constraints & energy curve) →
generateCandidatePoolLLM (filter catalog to a viable set) →
sequencePlanLLM (order tracks to hit duration & optimize flow) →
explainPlanLLM (rationale for track selection) →
validate (duration tolerance, existence, duplicates) →
finalize → export to Rekordbox/Serato
(AI off): createPlan uses deterministic heuristics and the same validators.

✅ Validation & Safety Rails
Duration tolerance (e.g., ±5 min around target)
No duplicates and all tracks exist in the catalog
Structured LLM prompts request JSON-only outputs with robust parsing & fallbacks to deterministic logic
🎨 User Experience
DJ lands on Discovery, enters an event description and seeds, and reviews a proposed crate
They can reprompt or issue targeted revisions ("swap the mid-set lull," "cap at 126 BPM")
After approval, the crate is saved to Library and exported
During performance, better track flow and energy progression → smoother set
🌟 What Makes It Different
Human-in-the-loop: Keeps the DJ's style central; AI accelerates, doesn't replace
Mix-aware planning: Not just "similar tracks"—explicitly optimizes energy flow and track progression
Operational compatibility: Produces playlists that drop into standard DJ software
⚠️ Risks & Limitations (and Mitigations)
Metadata quality variance: Track keys/BPM may be noisy → allow manual overrides; add auto-validators; encourage verified sources
LLM brittleness: Non-JSON or off-spec responses → strict schemas, retries, and graceful deterministic fallbacks
Style drift: AI suggestions may miss a DJ's "voice" → seed-driven planning + revision prompts + feedback memory
Catalog coverage: If the local library is thin, discovery may be limited → future integrations with external catalogs
📈 Success Metrics
Prep time reduction (minutes vs baseline hours)
User satisfaction (revision count to acceptance, thumbs-up rate)
Adoption (export count, repeat usage, crate reuse)
🗺️ Near-term Roadmap
Phrase alignment v1: Basic section detection to encourage 16/32-bar swaps
Energy modeling: Learn DJ-specific energy curves from feedback
Adaptive prompting: Auto-tune prompt variants based on failure cases
Import pipelines: Easier ingest from Beatport/Beatsource/record pools
Deeper export: Hot cue/beat grid hints (where metadata allows)
